    "Customer churn, also known as customer attrition or customer turnover, refers to the phenomenon of customers ending their relationship or ceasing their business with a company or brand. It occurs when customers stop using a product or service, unsubscribe from a subscription, or switch to a competitor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer churn is an essential metric for businesses across various industries, and analyzing it is crucial for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Revenue impact: Churn directly affects a company's revenue and profitability. Acquiring new customers is generally more expensive than retaining existing ones. By understanding and addressing the causes of churn, businesses can reduce customer attrition and maintain a more stable revenue stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer lifetime value: Churn impacts the customer lifetime value (CLV), which represents the total value a customer generates for a business over their entire relationship. By reducing churn, businesses can extend customer lifetimes, increase their CLV, and enhance overall profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer satisfaction and loyalty: Churn is often an indication of customer dissatisfaction or dissatisfaction with the product, service, or overall customer experience. Analyzing churn helps businesses identify pain points, improve customer satisfaction, and foster loyalty. Satisfied and loyal customers are more likely to become brand advocates, refer new customers, and provide positive reviews, contributing to business growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Market competition: Churn analysis provides insights into customer behavior and preferences, allowing businesses to identify trends and patterns. By understanding why customers are leaving and what attracts them to competitors, companies can adapt their strategies, enhance their offerings, and stay competitive in the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "## We are going to create a Machine Learning Model which predicts the customer churn rate and make analytical insinghts , then give report on why customers quite and how better to retain them "

    "Many of the features in our dataset are categorical (Strings or Non-Number Values) which is easier for humans to read but will make it difficult for Machine Learning Algorithms to work it . We are going to use a K fold Target Encoding which can convert these catagorial features to numerical values and retain meaningful information\n",
    "\n",
    "K-fold target encoding is a technique used to encode categorical features based on the target variable in a cross-validation setting. It involves splitting the training dataset into multiple folds, calculating the target mean for each category in the training portion of each fold, and then encoding the corresponding categories in the validation portion of that fold.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of k-fold target encoding is to address the issue of data leakage that can occur when encoding categorical features based on the entire training dataset. By performing target encoding within each fold separately, it helps to ensure that the encoding values are calculated based only on the information available in the training portion of that fold. This helps to prevent the model from learning unintended patterns or dependencies between the target variable and the categorical features."
